# Testing

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to implement any tests in this challenge. It turned out that I took more time developing the application's features.

There was only one day left to document and test, and I ended up prioritizing software documentation.

Even if I were to test the application components, it would probably take me a week to create the unit tests, and another week to create the integration tests.
