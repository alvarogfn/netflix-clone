# Clone da Netflix em Vue.js

## [See website](https://netflix-clone-alvarogfn.vercel.app/)

## [See detailed documentation](https://alvarogfn.github.io/spotify-clone/)

## Installing the dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

## Running a preview of the files generated by the build command

```sh
npm start
```

## Compile and Minify for Production with Docker

```sh
docker compose up
```

The application will be exposed at `http://localhost:3003` on your computer.

## Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

## Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

## Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
